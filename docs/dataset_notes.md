# Dataset Notes: NeRF Synthetic Lego

## Selection

The first Pareto-Splat baseline uses the Lego scene from the NeRF Synthetic
dataset introduced with NeRF. It is a useful first scene because it is small,
public, has exact camera poses, includes transparent image backgrounds, and is
supported directly by the pinned GraphDeco 3D Gaussian Splatting loader.

The source is the official NeRF example archive referenced by the authors'
repository:

- Archive:
  `https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/LF/papers/ECCV20/nerf/nerf_example_data.zip`
- Archive size: 370,385,516 bytes (353 MiB)
- SHA-256:

- Local scene: `data/nerf_synthetic/lego`
- Installed scene size: approximately 163 MiB

Run `make dataset` to download, verify, extract, and validate the scene. The
verified source archive is cached under `data/.downloads/` so the scene can be
recreated without another download.

## Format

The scene follows the NeRF Synthetic Blender convention:

```text
data/nerf_synthetic/lego/
├── transforms_train.json
├── transforms_val.json
├── transforms_test.json
├── train/   # 100 RGBA PNG images
├── val/     # 100 RGBA PNG images
└── test/    # 200 RGBA PNG images
```

Each transform file contains a horizontal camera field of view and a list of
4x4 camera-to-world matrices. Images are 800x800 RGBA PNGs. The baseline appends
`.png` to each frame's relative `file_path`.

`scripts/validate_nerf_synthetic.py` checks:

- The known 100/100/200 camera counts.
- Valid and consistent camera fields of view.
- Finite 4x4 transforms with valid homogeneous rows.
- Relative, non-overlapping image references.
- The existence and decodability of every referenced image.
- Consistent 800x800 RGBA PNG image properties.

## Baseline Use

The pinned GraphDeco loader uses `transforms_train.json` for optimization and
`transforms_test.json` for held-out evaluation when `--eval` is enabled. It
does not consume the validation split. The split is retained to preserve the
official dataset and support later ablations.

The PNG alpha channel must be composited onto white, so training and rendering
must use `--white_background`. Using the default black background changes the
ground-truth appearance and invalidates comparisons.

The prepared Session 4 training command is:

```bash
conda activate pareto3dsplat
make train-baseline
```

This runs 30,000 iterations at native resolution, evaluates and saves at 7,000
and 30,000 iterations, disables the network viewer, and writes the run to:

```text
results/baseline/lego/seed_0/
├── cfg_args
├── train.log
├── events.out.tfevents.*
├── input.ply
├── cameras.json
└── point_cloud/
    ├── iteration_7000/point_cloud.ply
    └── iteration_30000/point_cloud.ply
```

The official baseline initializes Python, NumPy, and PyTorch with seed `0`;
`configs/baseline.yaml` records that implementation-defined seed.
